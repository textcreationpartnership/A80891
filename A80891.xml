            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce my laſt of the 9 inſtant, here hath hapned little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction till Sunday and Munday laſt; at which time they made ſeverall Sallies both upon the Suffolk Forces and the Lord Generals. Gen. <hi>Lucas</hi> and the L. of <hi>Loughborow,</hi> with a party of Horſe and Firelocks made an attempt againſt the Guards neer the Almshouſes, our Horſe Guard charged them, and made an intervale through their whole Body, who upon their wheeling about, five piece of Ordnance were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the walls upon them, which killed two or three; then both parties bodied, and after a gallant charge by both Parties, the Colcheſterians retreat, our men purſues, and in the purſuit killed 7. and took 9. priſoners, with the loſſe of 5 men.</p>
            <p>C. <hi>Lunsford</hi> with another party ſallyed out at Buttolphs Gate, who fell upon our Out-guards with great fury, doing ſome execution, and took about 17. priſoners, but by the gallantry of Col. <hi>Barkſtead</hi> and a party of foot, they were repulſed, their priſoners releaſed, and Col. <hi>Lunsford</hi> and his party totally routed, and purſued to the very Gates and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ports, leaving divers of his men in a moſt deplorable and gaſping condition.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the Salliers which engaged in this action were Kentiſh-men, who fought with abundance of courage and reſolution, and maintained their ground to puſh-a-pike, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and mangling ſome of our horſe, vowing revenge upon us, for our late conqueſt in <hi>Kent,</hi> but in this action &amp; retreat they felt one hand more heavier then both, above twenty of them being ſlain in this ſhort diſpute and conflict: ſince
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170869:4"/>which time, they have declared, that they will fight it out to the laſt man, and maintain their Workes with the laſt drop of bloud, the ſhavers and others in the town, having alſo vowed the like reſolution, proteſting to ſacrifice their lives with them, againſt the Army, and all others that ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to them.</p>
            <p>They have ſunk ſeverall places under the Walls, and neer the Gates, who by countermining have blowd up one of our Mines, which hath ſomewhat retarded the work of ſtorming, yet we have four more almoſt finiſhed and ready to ſpring, and the better to faciliate the work of ſtorming, are raiſing of Batteries, and bringing our Trenches neerer the works, which we have accompliſhed with little loſſe: the Beſieged calls over the walls to our men, ſaying, That they deſire to exchange ſome tokens with in the town, and to welcome them over the walls with the meſſengers of <hi>Mars;</hi> and indeed, we are in a readineſſe to ſatisfie their longing deſires, the Councell of war having reſolved that approaches be made round the town in order to a ſtorme: And thereupon his Excellency with a Generall Councell of war conſiſting of all the Officers of Suſſex and Eſſex, aſwel as thoſe of the Army, debate high in relation to Colcheſter, endeavouring to make ſhort work of a long ſiege, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and inducements being theſe, 1. The Enemy having com for 20. dayes, 2. Their ſouldiers well ſatisfied with horſe-fleſh. 3. No want of freſh water, beſides much wine and fruit. 4. The City deſign much ripened, and may be ſpeedily put in execution. 5. The ſucceſſe in the North uncertain, and the Princes landing may prove prejudiciall, all which are motives to cauſe a ſtorm.</p>
